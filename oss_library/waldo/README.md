## Models

Gemma-2b-2-it- A simple model from Google released in 2024 for mainly text generation. We have used SynthID's watermarking and a cheeky watermarking method to add a watermark to the generated text.

StableDiffusion-v1-5- A simple model from HuggingFace released in 2024 for mainly image generation. We have used a custom noise injection method to add a watermark to the generated image.
